# Imgur Gallery App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Improvements and possible refactors (there might be more...)

- Migrate styling to .css files, did it this way as it was a bit faster to develop, specially the MUI components. BTW it's not one of my strengths the css/styling part.
- Improve validation and reset filters when some options are selected to respect the API constraints (it will work though with any combination of those as far as my manual tests passed)
- UX/UI definitely can be improved, but I assume it isn't the key of the challenge
